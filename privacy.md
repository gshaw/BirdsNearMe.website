Your privacy is important. This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in [Birds Near Me](/).

The app "Birds Near Me" uses eBird, Flickr, Wikipedia and Xeno-Canto so all of these sites will see what you are browsing as you use the app. If this is a problem for you then you should delete the app.

Google Analytics tracking was removed the app in version 1.5 released in March 2019 and will stay removed in all future versions.

Google Analytics tracking was removed this website in May 2023 and will stay removed. No analytcis or tracking is performed on the website.

This app is not motivated by advertising or commercial gain. I built it for myself and to share with the birding community in a way to give back for all that others have done for birds.
