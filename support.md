### Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Is there an Android version?** Not at this time and unlikely in near future.

2. **The app crashes when playing recordings.** This is a known issue and will be fixed in the next release. Something must have happened with the API or newer iOS verions that caused this. I'm having the same issues myself.

3. **When will the next release be?** Unfortunately this is hobby project of mine and since the app is given away it's hard to prioritize this over other other. Hopefully soon.
